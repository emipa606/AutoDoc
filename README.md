Update of Ordos mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2540157183

- Improved the texture to distinguish it from the vanilla cryopod
- Added save-support, it will now save any current progress
- Ingredients and the actual surgery will now be done at the end of the count, not at the start

Auto Doc
This mod is intended for solo character playthroughs that still want Bionics

-Tends to colonists inside 
-Operates if required ingredients are adjacent
-Can be opened without another pawn

Just queue up surgery for the pawn like normal then enter the pod and if the components are adjacent it will complete it. 

I'm currently busy so I won't be able to update it for now.
